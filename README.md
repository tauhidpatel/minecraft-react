## Introduction
The Minecraft Game built using ReactJS, Three.js, Zustand, and React Fiber libraries brings the fun of building and exploring a virtual world right to your browser. This game allows you to interact with the environment, place different types of blocks, and navigate the world with ease.

## How to Play
1. Use the mouse to look around and navigate your character.
2. Use the **W, A, S, D** keys to move your character forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
3. To switch between different types of blocks, use the **1-5** keys on your keyboard:
   - **1**: Grass
   - **2**: Wood
   - **3**: Log
   - **4**: Glass
   - **5**: Dirt
4. Left-click to add blocks to the world. Place the currently selected block by clicking on the desired location.
5. To remove blocks, press **Q** on your keyboard while left-clicking on the block you want to remove.
6. Your world is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so you can continue your building progress later.
